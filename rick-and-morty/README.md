How to create a React.js App using Vite:
Open Visual Studio Code.
Make a new Directory (mkdir MOD2)
cd into the Directory (cd MOD2/)

steps:
-npm create vite@latest
-project-name: rick-and-morty
(go ahead and enter a name for your project)
-Select a framework: React
(This select a framework option allows you to select any front-end framwork in which you want Vite to run, in this case, React.)

cd into your new project name

Unsolved Problems:
<!-- A LOT OF THEM!! -->

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
